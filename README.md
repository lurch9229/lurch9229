## Learning Python and Lua
### Pack Developer for Poptracker

I have been using lua and json for 5 years as a pack developer for a logic tracking program called [Poptracker](https://poptracker.github.io/)

I also work on logic algorithms for game randomizers, and I am currently working on creating an APWorld plugin for [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/)

Currently I am taking part in a skills workshop, learning Software Development, primarily using Python.
