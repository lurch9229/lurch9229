# Luke Young (Lurch9229) ðŸ‘‹
## Learning Python and Lua. Proficient in JSON
### Pack Developer for Poptracker

I have been using lua and json for 5 years as a pack developer for a logic tracking program called [Poptracker](https://poptracker.github.io/).
This involves creating maps, locations and logic algorithms to be used on an interface by the end-user. Useful for completionists, speedrunners and randomizer-enthusiasts

I also work on logic algorithms for game randomizers, and I am currently working on creating an APWorld plugin for [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/).
I have worked on the logic for current plugins such as [Ender Lilies](https://github.com/Trexounay/EnderLilies.Randomizer) and [Crosscode for Archipelago](https://github.com/CodeTriangle/Archipelago/tree/crosscode-dev/worlds/crosscode)

Currently I am taking part in a skills workshop with CoGrammar, learning Software Development, primarily using Python. I am looking
forward to working with them as I start my path towards a career in Software Development.
